    <!-- Specifies whether the dreams feature should be supported.
        When true, the system will allow the user to configure dreams (screensavers)
        to launch when a user activity timeout occurs or the system is told to nap.
        When false, the dreams feature will be disabled (this does not affect dozing).

        Consider setting this resource to false or disabling dreams by default when a
        doze component is specified below since dreaming will supercede dozing and
        will prevent the system from entering a low power state until the dream ends. -->
